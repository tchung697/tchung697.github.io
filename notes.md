I write notes to make sense of things I learn. 
Some of these notes are used in the courses for which I TA,
others are just for my own reference.

- [Horvitz-Thompson, Hajek, and Weighted Least Squares
Estimators](notes/ht-hajek-wls.html)

- [Potential Outcomes Framework in a
Nutshell](notes/potential-outcomes-nutshell.html)

- [Solutions to Problems in *A First Course in Causal
Inference* by Peng Ding](https://github.com/tchung697/first-course-exercises)

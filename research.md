We study the identification and estimation of long-term treatment effects under
unobserved confounding by combining an experimental sample, where the long-term
outcome is missing, with an observational sample, where the treatment assignment is
unobserved. While standard surrogate index methods fail when unobserved confounders
exist, we establish novel identification results by leveraging proxy variables for the
unobserved confounders. We further develop multiply robust estimation and inference
procedures based on these results. Applying our method to the Job Corps program,
we demonstrate its ability to recover experimental benchmarks even when unobserved
confounders bias standard surrogate index estimates.

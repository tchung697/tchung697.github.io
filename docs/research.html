      <h4>“The Proximal Surrogate Index: Long-Term Treatment Effects
      under Unobserved Confounding”</h4>
      <p>with <a href="https://yu-chang-chen.github.io/">Yu-Chang
      Chen</a> · <a

      <p>We study the identification and estimation of long-term
      treatment effects under unobserved confounding by combining an
      experimental sample, where the long-term outcome is missing, with
      an observational sample, where the treatment assignment is
      unobserved. While standard surrogate index methods fail when
      unobserved confounders exist, we establish novel identification
      results by leveraging proxy variables for the unobserved
      confounders. We further develop multiply robust estimation and
      inference procedures based on these results. Applying our method
      to the Job Corps program, we demonstrate its ability to recover
      experimental benchmarks even when unobserved confounders bias
      standard surrogate index estimates.</p>
